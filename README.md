# SVN Terminology Quick Reference

When comparing file versions, SVN uses these keywords:

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **BASE** | Your last updated version | What you had after your last `svn update` |
| **HEAD** | Server's latest version | The newest revision on the repository |
| **PREV** | Previous committed version | The revision before HEAD |

**Common scenarios:**
- **"Open Changes with BASE"** - Compare your edits to what you downloaded
- **"Open Changes with HEAD"** - See if server has newer changes
- **"Open File (HEAD)"** - View the server's latest without changing your local copy

# Features

### Checkout

You can checkout a SVN repository with the `SVN: Checkout` command in the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`). You will be asked for the URL of the repository and the parent directory under which to put the local repository.

* See commit messages

## Staging Area (Git-like Workflow)

This extension simulates Git's staging area using SVN changelists, enforcing a **"stage before commit"** workflow.

### How It Works

Files must be staged (or in a changelist) before committing:

1. **Stage files** - Click the `+` button or use "Stage" from context menu
2. **Review staged** - Files appear in "Staged for Commit" group
3. **Commit** - Press `Ctrl+Enter` or click the checkmark button

If no files are staged, you'll be prompted to "Stage All" before committing.

### Under the Hood

- Staging uses a hidden SVN changelist (`__staged__`)
- Files in custom changelists can also be committed directly
- Original changelist membership is restored when unstaging
- SVN automatically clears changelist membership after commit

### Why This Workflow?

- **Intentional commits** - Forces you to review what you're committing
- **Partial commits** - Commit only specific files, not everything
- **Familiar UX** - Works like Git for developers switching from Git
- **Non-destructive** - Original changelists preserved on unstage

### Quick Reference

| Action | Shortcut/Button |
|--------|-----------------|
| Stage file | `+` button or context menu |
| Stage all | `+` on Changes group header |
| Unstage file | `-` button or context menu |
| Unstage all | `-` on Staged group header |
| Commit staged | `Ctrl+Enter` or checkmark button |

## External Diff Tools

Configure external diff tools like Beyond Compare for large files (e.g., CSVs) where built-in diff is insufficient.

**Setup:**
1. Set `svn.diff.tool` to path of wrapper batch file (e.g., `bcsvn.bat`)
2. Right-click file in Source Control → **Diff with External Tool**
3. For Beyond Compare setup, see: https://www.scootersoftware.com/kb/vcs#svn

## File & Folder Decorations

The extension displays status badges and icons on files in the Explorer and Source Control views.

### Status Badges

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **A** | Added - new file scheduled for commit |
| **M** | Modified - file has local changes |
| **D** | Deleted - file scheduled for removal |
| **R** | Renamed/Replaced - file moved or replaced |
| **C** | Conflicted - merge conflict needs resolution |
| **U** | Unversioned - new file not yet added to SVN |
| **!** | Missing - file deleted outside SVN |
| **I** | Ignored - file matches ignore pattern |

### Folder Badges

Folders show the same status with a folder prefix:
- 📁A - Folder added
- 📁M - Folder with modified contents
- 📁D - Folder deleted

### Lock Icons

| Icon | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🔒 | File is locked (by you or others) |
| 🔓 | File has `svn:needs-lock` property (unlocked, read-only) |
| 🔒M | Locked and modified |
| 🔒A | Locked and added |

**Tooltip:** Hover over the lock icon to see who owns the lock.

### Combined Badges

When a file has both a status and lock, badges combine:
- 🔒M - Locked + Modified
- 🔒A - Locked + Added

## Smart File Renaming

When you rename tracked files in the Explorer, the extension automatically uses `svn move` to preserve file history.

**How it works:**
- Rename a tracked file via Explorer → extension intercepts and converts to `svn move`
- File history is preserved across the rename
- Untracked files are renamed normally (no SVN involvement)

**What you get:**
- Use the normal "Rename" command - no separate "SVN Rename" needed
- `svn log` shows full history including before the rename
- No "missing + unversioned" status after renaming

**Limitations:**
- Only intercepts renames within VS Code/Positron
- External tools (command line, file manager) won't trigger auto-conversion
- For external renames, manually use `svn move` or delete + add (loses history)

## Smart File Deletion

When you delete tracked files in the Explorer, the extension automatically runs `svn delete` to preserve proper version control.

**Default behavior:**
- Delete a tracked file via Explorer → extension runs `svn delete`
- File is immediately marked for deletion (D status)
- Untracked files are deleted normally (no SVN involvement)

**Setting:** `svn.delete.actionForDeletedFiles`
- `remove` (default) - Automatically run `svn delete`
- `prompt` - Ask what to do each time
- `none` - Do nothing (file shows as "missing" status)

## Repository History

View commit history for your repository in the dedicated History pane.

### Features

- **Commit list** - Browse all commits with author, date, and message
- **File changes** - Expand commits to see which files were modified
- **BASE indicator** - Purple **B** badge marks your working copy's BASE revision
- **Diff view** - Click files to see changes in that commit

### Toolbar Actions

| Button | Action | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| ↻ Refresh | Refresh from cache | Quick refresh using cached log data |
| ↓ Fetch | Fetch from server | Get latest commits from server, update cache |
| ↓↓ Pull | Fetch + Update | Fetch latest AND update working copy to HEAD |

**When to use each:**
- **Refresh** - Just redraw the UI (instant, no server contact)
- **Fetch** - See new commits without changing your files
- **Pull** - Get new commits AND update your working copy

### BASE Revision

The **B** badge (purple) indicates your working copy's BASE revision - the revision you last updated to.

- Commits above BASE = newer changes on server (not in your working copy yet)
- BASE commit = what your working copy is based on
- Commits below BASE = older history

**Tip:** If you see commits above BASE, use "Pull" or `svn update` to get them.

### File History

Right-click a file → **Show File History** to see commits that modified that specific file.

From file history, you can:
- **Go to Repository History** - Jump to that revision in the full repo log
- **Open file at revision** - View file contents at that point in time
- **Compare revisions** - Diff between any two versions

## Blame Annotations

View line-by-line revision history directly in the editor.

**Features:**
- Gutter annotations: colored revision indicators (enabled by default)
- Inline messages: commit details at end of line, GitLens-style (enabled by default)
- Status bar: blame info for current line
- Auto-blame: automatically show blame when files open (enabled by default)
- Hover tooltips: detailed commit info on hover

**Configuration:**
See all 19 configuration options in Settings → search "svn.blame"

For advanced configuration, see [Blame System Documentation](docs/BLAME_SYSTEM.md).

## Positron Integration

Enhanced integration with Posit's Positron IDE for data science workflows.

**Connections Pane**:
- View SVN repositories alongside database connections
- Quick checkout wizard with URL and directory inputs
- Repository metadata display (branch, revision, remote URL)

**Setup**: Automatically enabled when running in Positron. No configuration needed.

**Privacy**: All operations are local. No data sent to Posit or external services. See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) for details.

**What is Positron?** A next-generation IDE for data science by Posit PBC (creators of RStudio). Fork of VS Code optimized for R, Python, and Julia workflows.

## Authentication & Security

The extension provides secure authentication with multiple methods and comprehensive credential protection.

### Security Warning: Upgrade from v2.17.229 or Earlier

> **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Versions prior to v2.17.230 expose passwords in process listings. **Upgrade immediately** to v2.17.230+ to eliminate this security risk.

### Authentication Methods

**Recommended (in priority order):**

1. **SSH Key Authentication** ⭐ BEST PRACTICE
   - **Repository URL:** `svn+ssh://user@svn.example.com/repo`
   - **Security:** Public key cryptography, zero credential exposure
   - **Setup:**
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ssh-copy-id user@svn.example.com
     ```
   - **When to use:** Production environments, shared servers, automated systems

2. **Password Authentication** (Secure with Credential Cache)
   - **Repository URL:** `https://svn.example.com/repo`
   - **Security:** Credentials stored in SVN cache (`~/.subversion/auth/`, mode 600)
   - **Setup:** Extension prompts for password, automatically caches securely
   - **When to use:** Quick testing, HTTPS-only repositories, personal projects

3. **Public Repository** (No Authentication)
   - **Repository URL:** `http://svn.example.com/public-repo`
   - **Security:** No credentials needed
   - **When to use:** Open-source projects, publicly accessible repositories

### How Credential Caching Works

**v2.17.230+** uses SVN's native credential cache for maximum security:

1. You enter username/password in VS Code UI prompt
2. Extension writes credentials to `~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/<uuid>` (file mode 600)
3. SVN commands executed **without** `--password` flag
4. SVN reads credentials from cache automatically
5. ✅ **Result:** No password exposure in process list, container logs, or CI/CD logs

**Before v2.17.230:**
```bash
$ ps aux | grep svn
user 12345 svn update --password "MyPassword123"  # ❌ EXPOSED
```

**After v2.17.230:**
```bash
$ ps aux | grep svn
user 12345 svn update --username alice  # ✅ SECURE (no password)
```

### Authentication Method Indicators

Extension shows which auth method is active in the Output panel:

- `[auth: SSH key]` - SSH key authentication (most secure)
- `[auth: password via credential cache]` - Cached password (secure)
- `[auth: none - public repository]` - No authentication required

**Example output:**
```
[my-project]$ svn update --username alice [auth: password via credential cache]
At revision 1234.
```

This helps verify your authentication is configured correctly.

### Debugging Authentication Issues

#### Enable Verbose Output

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run: `SVN: Show Output`
3. Check authentication method indicators in logs

#### Common Issues

**Problem:** "Authentication failed" but credentials are correct
```
[repo]$ svn update --username alice [auth: password via credential cache]
svn: E170001: Authentication failed
```

**Solutions:**
1. Clear credential cache: `rm -rf ~/.subversion/auth/`
2. Re-enter credentials when prompted
3. Verify repository URL is correct
4. Check SVN server is accessible: `svn info <repo-url>`

**Problem:** Extension prompts for password repeatedly
```
ℹ No credentials configured - will prompt if needed
```

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure credentials are being cached (check `~/.subversion/auth/`)
2. Verify file permissions: `ls -la ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/` (should be 600)
3. Try manual SVN command: `svn update` (should not prompt if cache works)

**Problem:** Want to see raw error messages for debugging

**Solution:** Enable debug mode (⚠️ **TEMPORARY ONLY**):
```json
{
  "svn.debug.disableSanitization": true
}
```

**⚠️ WARNING:**
- Debug mode exposes credentials in logs
- Extension shows prominent warning when enabled
- Only enable temporarily for troubleshooting
- **Disable immediately after debugging**

When enabled, you'll see:
```
⚠️⚠️⚠️ SECURITY WARNING ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Error sanitization is DISABLED
Credentials WILL BE VISIBLE in logs
Disable: svn.debug.disableSanitization = false
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
```

Plus a dialog with **[Disable Now]** button.

#### Verify Authentication Setup

**Check credential cache:**
```bash
# List cached credentials
ls -la ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/

# Should show files with permissions: -rw------- (600)
```

**Check SVN version:**
```bash
svn --version
# Requires SVN 1.6+ for credential cache
```

**Test repository access:**
```bash
svn info <your-repo-url>
# Should show repository information without prompting
```

### Best Practices

#### Production Environments
- ✅ Use SSH keys (`svn+ssh://`)
- ✅ Enable MFA on SVN server
- ✅ Keep SVN client updated
- ❌ Never use `svn.debug.disableSanitization` in production
- ❌ Avoid HTTP URLs (use HTTPS or svn+ssh://)

#### Development Workstations
- ✅ Use HTTPS with credential cache for personal projects
- ✅ Use SSH keys for shared/company repositories
- ✅ Protect `~/.subversion/auth/` directory (mode 700)
- ✅ Regularly update extension and SVN client

#### CI/CD Pipelines
- ✅ Use SSH keys stored in CI/CD secrets
- ✅ Use repository access tokens (if supported by SVN server)
- ❌ Never pass passwords via environment variables
- ❌ Never commit credentials to `.vscode/settings.json`

**Example GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
- name: Setup SSH key
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    echo "${{ secrets.SVN_SSH_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
- run: svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.example.com/repo
```

### Security Features

1. **Error Sanitization**
   - Automatic redaction of passwords, tokens, paths, URLs
   - Active by default in all logs and error messages
   - Protects against accidental credential exposure

2. **SecretStorage Integration**
   - Passwords stored in OS keychain (encrypted)
     - **macOS:** Keychain Access
     - **Windows:** Credential Manager
     - **Linux:** Secret Service (gnome-keyring, KWallet)
   - Never stored in plaintext in extension settings

3. **Credential Cache Protection**
   - Files stored with mode 600 (user-only access)
   - Automatic cleanup of old credentials
   - Isolated per repository/realm

4. **Audit Trail**
   - All auth operations logged (credentials redacted)
   - Authentication method always visible
   - Debug mode warnings prevent accidental exposure

### Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] Check authentication method indicator in Output panel
- [ ] Verify repository URL is correct (HTTPS vs svn+ssh://)
- [ ] Test SVN access outside VS Code: `svn info <repo-url>`
- [ ] Check credential cache: `ls ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/`
- [ ] Verify SVN version: `svn --version` (requires 1.6+)
- [ ] Review error messages in Output panel
- [ ] Try clearing cache: `rm -rf ~/.subversion/auth/` and re-enter credentials
- [ ] For persistent issues, enable debug mode temporarily (see above)

### Credential Storage

The extension supports multiple credential storage modes via `svn.auth.credentialMode`:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auto` (default) | System keyring locally, extension storage remotely |
| `systemKeyring` | Always use OS credential manager |
| `extensionStorage` | Always use VS Code SecretStorage |
| `prompt` | Never store credentials |

#### Auto Mode (Recommended)

The default `auto` mode automatically selects the best storage:
- **Local development**: Uses system keyring (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, gnome-keyring)
- **Remote SSH/WSL/Containers**: Uses VS Code SecretStorage (works without keyring setup)

#### System Keyring Mode

Uses native credential managers:
- **macOS:** Keychain
- **Windows:** Credential Manager
- **Linux:** gnome-keyring, gpg-agent

For gpg-agent in SSH sessions, set `GPG_TTY`:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```

#### Troubleshooting Auth

If password prompts cycle endlessly:

1. Try `extensionStorage` mode:
   ```json
   { "svn.auth.credentialMode": "extensionStorage" }
   ```
2. Restart extension host (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Restart Extension Host")
3. Re-enter credentials when prompted

#### Auth Method Indicators

Watch the Output panel (SVN) for current mode:
- `[auth: system keyring (local)]` - Using OS credential manager
- `[auth: extension storage (remote)]` - Using VS Code SecretStorage
