# Stage Your Changes

Staging lets you select which changes to include in your next commit.

## Stage Individual Files

1. Open Source Control view
2. Hover over a changed file
3. Click the **+** icon to stage

## Stage All Changes

- Click **Stage All** in the Changes group header
- Or run **SVN: Stage All** from Command Palette

## Unstage

- Click the **−** icon on staged files
- Or run **SVN: Unstage All**

## Skip Staging

You can also commit directly without staging:

- Use **SVN: Commit All** to commit everything
- Or disable staging in settings: `"svn.sourceControl.showUnstagedFiles": true`

## Tip

Staging helps create focused, logical commits.
