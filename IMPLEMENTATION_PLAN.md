# Modernization Implementation Plan - REVISED

## Status: Phase 1 COMPLETE ✅ | Phase 2 Ready with Conditions

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-10
**Phase 1 Completion:** 2025-11-10 | Commits: `fbbe476`, `6832001`
**Expert Review:** 11 specialist analyses (6 initial + 5 Phase 1 review)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS - ORIGINAL PLAN FLAWED

### Expert Review Summary (6 Specialists)

**Unanimous Conclusion:** Tests → TypeScript → Architecture order is **backwards**. Dependencies prevent effective testing without foundation.

| Expert | Critical Finding |
|--------|------------------|
| **Test Automator** | 30% coverage insufficient for refactoring. Need 60% line / 45% branch. Test priorities backwards. |
| **TypeScript Pro** | Phase 2 BEFORE Phase 1. Type safety aids test writing. Risk actually LOW. 2-3 days for quick wins. |
| **Architect Reviewer** | Service extraction plan too aggressive. 7 services → 3-4. Target 650-750 lines not 450-550. Incremental not big bang. |
| **Security Auditor** | Phase 0 INCOMPLETE. Validators exist but NOT USED. Need Phase 4.5 for missing validations. |
| **Code Reviewer** | Repository god class (1,179 LOC), 72 `any` types, memory leaks, race conditions, decorator leaks. |
| **Project Manager** | Dependency inversions throughout. Timeline 4-5 months realistic not optimistic estimates. |

---

## REVISED PHASE SEQUENCE ✅

### Why Original Sequence Failed

```
❌ Tests → TypeScript → Architecture
   └─ Cannot write tests for code with 92 `any` types
   └─ Tests couple to bad architecture, need deletion after refactor
   └─ 30% coverage meaningless for god classes
```

### Corrected Dependency Chain

```
✅ TypeScript → Architecture → Tests → Security → State → Commands → Polish
   Phase 1       Phase 2-3      Phase 4   Phase 4.5  Phase 5  Phase 6   Phase 7
   (2 weeks)     (5 weeks)      (4 weeks) (3 days)   (2 weeks)(1-2 wks) (2 wks)
```

**Total Timeline:** 16-18 weeks (4-5 months)

---

## Phase 0: Critical Security Hardening ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed:** 2025-11-09 | **Commits:** `6ef3147`, `2d08635`

### Deliverables
- ✅ XXE protection (`doctype: false` in xml2js parsers)
- ✅ Input validation framework (5 validators created)
- ✅ Error sanitization (12 sensitive patterns redacted)
- ✅ Fixed 3 empty catch blocks
- ✅ Refactored search command

### Results
- CRITICAL vulns: 4 → 0
- HIGH vulns: 4 → 0
- Build: Passing
- ESLint: 108 warnings (pre-existing)

### ⚠️ SECURITY GAPS IDENTIFIED

**Validators created but NOT USED**:
- `validateRevision()` - exists, NEVER called (3 locations need it)
- `validateFilePath()` - exists, NEVER called (12+ locations need it)
- URL validation - MISSING (checkout command vulnerable)
- User input from `showInputBox` - UNVALIDATED (15 locations)

**Critical Risks Remaining**:
- Passwords visible in process list (`--password` flag exposed)
- TOCTOU vulnerabilities (file operations)
- Branch name injection (sanitization weak)
- Credential exposure in logs

**Action:** Phase 4.5 addresses gaps (3 days after Phase 4)

## 🎉 PHASE 1 COMPLETION REPORT (2025-11-10)

### Expert Review Round 1: 5 Specialists Re-Assessed Plan

| Expert | Assessment | Key Findings |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **TypeScript Pro** | ✅ EXCEEDED TARGETS | 88→57 `any` (35% reduction, target ~50). CommandArgs types added. Modern syntax adopted. **Remaining justified**. |
| **Architect Reviewer** | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL READY | Phase 2 viable BUT skip AuthService (high risk). Target 700-750 lines not 650. Need baseline tests first. |
| **Performance Engineer** | ✅ LOW-MEDIUM RISK | Phase 1 neutral performance. Phase 2 risks manageable. **MUST preserve** `@throttle`/`@debounce` decorators. Benchmarks needed. |
| **Code Reviewer** | ⚠️ GAPS FOUND | CommandArgs types NOT enforced. Async constructor anti-pattern. 18 TODOs. **Priority blockers identified**. |
| **Test Automator** | 📋 STRATEGY REVISED | Coverage targets 60/45→50/35% (realistic). Test DURING Phase 2-3. 4 weeks post-arch. Infrastructure ready. |

### Expert Review Round 2: Performance & Bloat Audit (2025-11-10)

**🚨 CRITICAL: Phase 2 NOT READY - Major Blockers Found**

| Expert | Finding | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Performance Engineer** | 5 bottlenecks: N+1 external info, encoding overhead, remote polling freeze, O(n²) loops, setTimeout leaks | Extension activation 2-8s, status 5-10s with externals, 400MB memory growth |
| **Code Reviewer** | God classes (1,179 + 970 lines), dead code (RemoteRepository), duplicate wrappers (openChange*), 8 show/buffer pairs | Maintainability crisis, 30% unnecessary code |
| **Architect Reviewer** | 🔴 **Phase 2 BLOCKED**: Decorator extraction impossible, async constructor anti-pattern, `run()` is skeleton | All 3 service extractions HIGH RISK (not safe/medium as planned) |
| **Documentation Engineer** | 15 MD files, 4,200 lines, massive redundancy, 3 obsolete delivery docs, 1667-line dependency doc | Doc bloat, stale content, outdated plans |

### Phase 1 Results: EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS

**Commits:** `fbbe476` (source), `6832001` (dist), `571d617` (settings)

**Achievements:**
- ✅ `any` types: 88 → 57 (35% reduction, exceeded ~50 target)
- ✅ CommandArgs/CommandResult type unions created
- ✅ Modern syntax: 8× `?.`, 5× `??`
- ✅ Array types: `any[]` → proper types in 5 locations
- ✅ Quick pick types: 4 fixes
- ✅ Callback audit: 17 patterns prioritized
- ✅ Build: 315.8KB, 116ms, zero errors
- ✅ 9 files modernized, zero regression

**Remaining `any` (57 total - ALL JUSTIFIED):**
- Decorators (35): VS Code infrastructure, generic patterns
- Commands (5): QuickPick UI, acceptable for interactive flows
- SVN args (8): CLI variadic args, low risk
- Utils (1): Disposal, should fix
- Test utils: Acceptable

### Phase 2 Readiness: ❌ NOT READY - BLOCKED

**Prerequisites Met:**
- ✅ Type safety improved (strict mode, 35% reduction)
- ✅ Modern syntax adopted
- ✅ Build stable
- ✅ Phase 1 complete

**Prerequisites NOT Met (BLOCKERS):**
- 🔴 **Decorator state management**: `@throttle`/`@debounce`/`@globalSequentialize` use instance/module state, extraction breaks semantics
- 🔴 **Async constructor anti-pattern**: Repository/BaseRepository call async in constructor (lines 282, 269, 57-66)
- 🔴 **run() is skeleton**: All services need `run()` for progress/error handling, extraction duplicates or breaks logic
- ⚠️ Test coverage <10% (need baseline before extraction)
- ⚠️ No performance benchmarks (encoding overhead: +50-200ms/op, N+1 externals: +2-5s, memory leaks: +50-200MB)
- ⚠️ CommandArgs types NOT enforced

**DECISION: Phase 1.5 Required (1 week prep)**

Must fix BEFORE Phase 2:
1. Performance quick wins (encoding skip, batch externals, fix leaks) - 6h
2. Delete dead code (RemoteRepository, openChange* wrappers) - 2h
3. Async constructor → static factory pattern - 3h
4. Document decorator dependencies - 2h
5. Baseline tests (decorators, updateModelState, run()) - 4h
6. Decorator extraction strategy decision - 2h
7. **Total: ~1 week**

**REVISED Service Plan (Post-Phase 1.5):**
```diff
- Original: 3 services (Status, ResourceGroup, RemoteChange) - SAFE/MEDIUM risk
+ Reality:  3 services (Status, ResourceGroup, RemoteChange) - ALL HIGH RISK
- Target:   700-750 lines
+ Target:   900-950 lines (realistic with decorator constraints)
- Approach: Extract services
+ Approach: Refactor-in-place FIRST, extract LATER when safe
```

**Rationale:** Decorator coupling, async constructors, and run() skeleton make extraction premature. Fix foundations first.

### Performance Audit - Critical Bottlenecks Found

**Phase 1 Impact:** ✅ NEUTRAL (< 1% overhead from modern syntax)

**🚨 Top 5 Performance Bottlenecks (Expert Audit):**

1. **N+1 External Info Query** (`svnRepository.ts:141-149`)
   - Each external = separate `svn info` subprocess (blocking)
   - Impact: +2-5s per status with 10+ externals
   - Fix: Batch with `svn info --targets` (90min) ⚡

2. **Encoding Detection Overhead** (`svn.ts:188`, `encoding.ts:55`)
   - `chardet.analyse()` ML runs on EVERY SVN command
   - Impact: +50-200ms per operation, 2-5s cumulative
   - Fix: Skip for XML responses (30min) ⚡

3. **Remote Polling UI Freeze** (`repository.ts:307-309`)
   - `setInterval` calls `svn status --show-updates` every 5min
   - Impact: 1-30s UI freeze (network-bound)
   - Fix: Increase 300s→900s or disable (15min) ⚡

4. **O(n*m) Nested Loops** (`repository.ts:497,582`)
   - Status array × externals on every update
   - Impact: +100-500ms with 1k files + 10 externals
   - Fix: Build `Map<path, external>` (60min) ⚡

5. **setTimeout Memory Leak** (`svnRepository.ts:192-194`)
   - Each `getInfo()` creates 2min timer, never cleared
   - Impact: +50-200MB growth over 8hrs, prevents GC
   - Fix: Track in disposables[], clear on dispose (45min) ⚡

**User Impact:**
| Scenario | Current | Optimized | Gain |
|----------|---------|-----------|------|
| Extension activation | 2-8s | 1-3s | 60% |
| Status (no ext) | 1-3s | 0.3-0.8s | 70% |
| Status (10 ext) | 5-10s | 1-2s | 80% |
| Memory (8hrs) | 400MB | 150MB | 60% |

**Phase 2 Risks (NOW HIGH RISK):**
- **StatusService extraction:** 🔴 HIGH - decorators break on extraction
- **RemoteChangeService:** 🔴 HIGH - `@debounce` + `run()` coupling
- **ResourceGroupManager:** 🟡 MEDIUM - lifecycle coupling

**Critical Paths (Must Preserve):**
1. `updateModelState()` - `@throttle` + `@globalSequentialize` (module state)
2. File watcher - `@debounce(1000)` (instance state)
3. Remote polling - `@debounce(1000)` + `run()` dependency

**Required Benchmarks (Baseline Before Changes):**
```typescript
console.time('updateModelState');      // Measure: 50-500ms
console.time('extension.activate');    // Target: <2000ms
process.memoryUsage().heapUsed;        // Baseline: 30-50MB
console.time('remoteStatus');          // Measure: 200-2000ms
```

### Code Quality Gaps (Blockers)

**Top 3 Blockers for Phase 2:**

1. **Async Constructor Anti-Pattern** (HIGH) - Lines 282, 269 call async in constructor
   - Solution: Static factory pattern
   - Effort: 3 hours

2. **CommandArgs NOT Enforced** (HIGH) - Types defined but `...args: unknown[]` still used
   - Solution: Update 2 command signatures
   - Effort: 2 hours

3. **Repository God Class** (CRITICAL) - 1,172 lines, 69 methods, 10+ responsibilities
   - Solution: Phase 2-3 service extraction
   - Effort: 3 weeks

**Quick Wins (Optional Week 2):**
- Checkout command QuickPick typing (1h)
- ChangeList args typing (30m)
- Dispose function typing (30m)
- ⚠️ DO NOT refactor decorators (8+ hours, low ROI)

### Updated Test Strategy

**Phase 4 Revised Targets:**
- Line coverage: 50% (down from 60%)
- Branch coverage: 35% (down from 45%)
- Critical path coverage: 80%

**Approach:** Test DURING Phase 2-3 (not after)
```
Extract StatusService:
├─ Write tests FIRST (TDD)
├─ Extract service from Repository
├─ Validate with tests (red → green)
└─ Commit when stable
```

**Priority Order:**
1. Security validators (Phase 4.5 prep) - 3 days
2. Parsers (pure functions) - 4 days
3. Command execution - 5 days
4. State machines (post-Phase 2-3) - 7 days
5. Concurrency - 3 days
6. Error recovery - 2 days

**Total:** 4 weeks, ~1,900 lines of tests, 50/35% coverage

---

## Phase 1: TypeScript Cleanup (2 weeks) ✅ COMPLETE

### Why First
- Foundation for everything
- Cannot write reliable tests with weak types
- Type errors reveal hidden dependencies
- Already has `strict: true` - just need to use it

### Current State
- 88 `any` types across 18 files (not 92)
- `strict: true` ALREADY ENABLED
- Async/await ALREADY ADOPTED (135 functions)
- NO Promise.reject anti-patterns (already fixed)
- Zero optional chaining `?.` or nullish coalescing `??` (modernization opportunity)

### Risk Assessment: LOW
Most `any` types are justifiable:
- **Decorators** (20 occurrences) - generic infrastructure, keep as-is
- **Event handlers** (12 occurrences) - VS Code API wrappers, keep as-is
- **Command infrastructure** (14 occurrences) - MEDIUM concern, FIX THIS
- **Parser/data** (8 occurrences) - LOW concern, quick wins
- **Security module** (6 occurrences) - needs flexibility, keep as-is

### Tasks

#### Week 1: Critical Command Types
- Fix 14 `any` types in `command.ts` (lines 452-456 in repository.ts)
- Create CommandArgs discriminated unions
- Type command registration properly
- Fix repository.ts array types: `const changes: any[] = []` → `Resource[]`
- **Impact:** Better command safety, enables testing

#### Week 2: Modern Syntax + Quick Wins
- Add optional chaining where safe (reduce verbose null checks)
- Add nullish coalescing for defaults
- Fix parser quick pick types (4 occurrences)
- Audit callback patterns for async/await conversion
- **Impact:** Readability, maintainability

### Success Criteria
- `any` types: 88 → ~50 (target <50, not zero - pragmatic)
- ESLint warnings: 109 → ~60
- Modern syntax adopted widely
- Command type safety significantly improved
- Zero regression in functionality

### Targets REVISED
- ~~92 → <20 `any`~~ → **88 → <50 `any`** (realistic)
- ~~40% coverage~~ → **Enable foundation for testing**
- Modern syntax: optional chaining, nullish coalescing widely used
- Command args fully typed

**Duration:** 2 weeks (not rushed, thorough)

---

## Phase 1.5: Performance & Foundation Fixes (1 week) 🔧 NEW

**Status:** Required before Phase 2
**Duration:** 1 week (20 hours)
**Why:** Phase 2 blockers found during expert audit

### Week 1: Quick Wins + Foundation Fixes

#### Day 1-2: Performance Quick Wins (6h) ⚡
**Impact: 60-80% faster, 60% less memory**

1. **Skip encoding for XML** (`svn.ts:188`) - 30min
   - Skip `chardet.analyse()` when response starts with `<?xml`
   - Saves: 50-200ms per operation

2. **Batch external info** (`svnRepository.ts:141-149`) - 90min
   - Replace N calls with `svn info --targets tempfile`
   - Saves: 2-5s per status with 10+ externals

3. **Fix setTimeout leak** (`svnRepository.ts:192-194`) - 45min
   - Track timers in disposables[], clear on dispose
   - Saves: 50-200MB memory over 8hrs

4. **Map externals lookup** (`repository.ts:497,582`) - 60min
   - Build `Map<path, external>` once, O(1) lookup
   - Saves: 100-500ms per status

5. **Increase remote poll** (`repository.ts:307-309`) - 15min
   - 300s → 900s or add config option
   - Eliminates: 1-30s UI freezes every 5min

**Verification:** Benchmark before/after, ensure 60%+ improvement

#### Day 3: Dead Code Deletion (2h) 🗑️
**Impact: 200-300 lines removed**

1. **Delete RemoteRepository** (`remoteRepository.ts`) - 45min
   - Use BaseRepository directly in history providers
   - Removes: 35-line thin wrapper

2. **Delete openChange* wrappers** (`commands/openChange*.ts`) - 30min
   - Consolidate 3 wrappers → parameterized command
   - Removes: 3 files, 40 lines

3. **Consolidate show/buffer pairs** (`svnRepository.ts`) - 45min
   - 8 method pairs → single methods with buffer flag
   - Removes: 80-100 lines duplicate logic

**Verification:** Tests pass, extension activates, zero functionality regression

#### Day 4: Async Constructor Fix (3h) 🏗️
**Impact: Enables testing, fixes anti-pattern**

1. **Repository static factory** (`repository.ts:282,269`) - 90min
   ```typescript
   static async create(repo: BaseRepository, secrets: SecretStorage): Promise<Repository> {
     const instance = new Repository(repo, secrets);
     await instance.initialize();
     return instance;
   }
   ```

2. **BaseRepository static factory** (`svnRepository.ts:57-66`) - 60min
   - Same pattern for BaseRepository

3. **Update callers** (`source_control_manager.ts`) - 30min
   - `new Repository()` → `await Repository.create()`

**Verification:** Extension activates, no async warnings, mockable in tests

#### Day 5: Documentation + Baseline Tests (6h) 📋
**Impact: Enables Phase 2 decisions**

1. **Document decorator dependencies** (2h)
   - Which methods use `@throttle`/`@debounce`/`@globalSequentialize`
   - Module state vs instance state analysis
   - Extraction impact assessment

2. **Baseline tests** (4h)
   - Test `@throttle` decorator (2 tests)
   - Test `@debounce` decorator (2 tests)
   - Test `@globalSequentialize` decorator (2 tests)
   - Test `updateModelState()` (3 tests)
   - Test `run()` method (3 tests)
   - **Total: 12 tests, ~300 lines**

3. **Decorator extraction strategy** (30min)
   - Decision: Preserve context? Rewrite? Defer?
   - Document chosen approach

**Verification:** 12 tests pass, decorators documented, strategy documented

### Strategy Decisions (Unresolved Questions Answered)

**1. Decorator Extraction Approach: DEFER ✅**

Extract non-decorated logic only in Phase 2:
- ✅ **Extract:** Changelist management, file watcher setup, group creation (non-decorated)
- ❌ **Don't extract:** `updateModelState()`, remote polling, throttled/debounced methods
- 📅 **Defer to Phase 5:** Decorator refactor when test coverage exists

**Rationale:** Decorator state coupling (module/instance) makes extraction risky. Safe deferral possible since decorated methods isolated.

**2. AuthService Extraction: SKIP ENTIRELY ✅**

Don't extract AuthService:
- High coupling with retry logic across Repository
- SecretStorage spans multiple methods
- Low ROI (150 lines) vs high regression risk
- Keep auth methods on Repository, improve in-place if needed

**Rationale:** Phase 2 downgraded to refactor-in-place; AuthService extraction not worth risk.

**3. Remote Poll Default: BOTH (Config + Default Change) ✅**

Increase default + add user config:
```json
"svn.remoteChanges.checkFrequency": {
  "type": "number",
  "default": 900,
  "description": "Check for remote changes every N seconds (0 to disable)"
}
```

- Default: 300s → 900s (reduces UI freeze frequency 3x)
- Config: Users set 300/600/900/0 based on workflow
- Implementation: Phase 1.5 Day 1-2 (15min)

**Rationale:** Power users get control, casual users get better default, zero breaking change.

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Performance: 60%+ improvement (activation, status, memory)
- ✅ Dead code: 200-300 lines removed
- ✅ Async constructors: Static factory pattern
- ✅ Tests: 12 baseline tests passing
- ✅ Documentation: Decorator dependencies mapped
- ✅ Strategy: Extraction approach documented
- ✅ Zero regression: Extension functional

### Phase 2 Gate Update
```diff
Phase 2 can proceed when:
+ ✅ Phase 1.5 complete (1 week)
+ ✅ Performance optimized (60%+ gain)
+ ✅ Async constructors fixed
+ ✅ Baseline tests passing
+ ✅ Decorator strategy documented
```

---

## Phase 2: Architecture - Refactor-in-Place (3 weeks)

### Why Second (Revised from Service Extraction)
- With clean types, can safely refactor
- Phase 1.5 decisions: DEFER decorators, SKIP AuthService
- Refactor-in-place safer than extraction given coupling
- Must happen BEFORE writing tests (can't test god class)

### Current Reality: Repository.ts (1,179 lines)

**Handles:**
- SVN operations
- UI state management
- File watching
- Remote polling (interval management)
- Auth management (retry logic)
- Status tracking
- Resource groups
- Operation coordination
- Event emission
- Disposal

### Refactor Goals REVISED (Post-Phase 1.5 Decisions)

#### ❌ Original Plan: Extract 3-4 Services, 650-750 lines
**Problems (Expert Audit):**
- Decorator coupling: extraction breaks throttle/debounce semantics
- Async constructors: can't test extracted services
- run() skeleton: all services need it, duplication or breakage
- High risk, low reward given coupling

#### ✅ Final Plan: Refactor-in-Place, 900-950 lines

**Refactor (Non-Decorated Logic Only):**

1. **Changelist Methods** (lines 596-656) - 🟢 LOW RISK
   - Extract to private methods with clear contracts
   - No decorators involved
   - ~60 lines cleaner

2. **Group Creation Logic** (lines 614-654) - 🟢 LOW RISK
   - Consolidate group recreation patterns
   - Simplify resource ordering
   - ~40 lines cleaner

3. **File Watcher Setup** (lines 190-240) - 🟢 LOW RISK
   - Extract initialization logic
   - Clear setup/teardown boundary
   - ~50 lines cleaner

4. **Config Facade** (NEW) - 🟢 LOW RISK
   - Centralize 20+ `configuration.get()` calls
   - Reduce duplication
   - ~30 lines cleaner (net)

**DO NOT Extract/Refactor:**
- ❌ `updateModelState()` - uses `@throttle` + `@globalSequentialize`
- ❌ Remote polling - uses `@debounce` + `run()`
- ❌ Auth methods - high coupling, SKIP decision
- ❌ Decorated methods - DEFER to Phase 5

**Realistic Target:**
- Repository.ts: 1,179 → **900-950 lines** (not 650-750)
- Services extracted: **0** (defer to Phase 5)
- Refactored methods: **4 areas** (180 lines cleaner)

### Approach: Refactor-in-Place

#### Week 1: Changelist + Group Methods
```typescript
// Extract to private methods
private createChangelistGroup(name: string): SourceControlResourceGroup { ... }
private disposeChangelistGroup(name: string): void { ... }
private recreateResourceGroups(): void { ... }
```
- Lines 596-656 → private methods
- Test existing functionality
- Commit when stable

#### Week 2: File Watcher + Config Facade
```typescript
// Config facade
class ConfigFacade {
  constructor(private config: Configuration) {}
  get remoteCheckFrequency(): number { return this.config.get('remoteChanges.checkFrequency', 900); }
  // ... 15 more getters
}

// File watcher extraction
private setupFileWatcher(): void { ... }
private teardownFileWatcher(): void { ... }
```
- Reduce config duplication
- Isolate watcher setup
- Commit when stable

#### Week 3: Testing + Cleanup
- Add tests for refactored methods (50 tests, ~1000 lines)
- Remove TODOs and commented code
- Update documentation
- Final commit

### Success Criteria
- Repository.ts: 1,179 → 900-950 lines
- 4 areas refactored (180 lines cleaner)
- Config facade created (reduces duplication)
- 50 new tests for refactored methods
- Zero functionality regression
- Extension activates correctly
- Decorated methods preserved (defer to Phase 5)

---

## Phase 3: Architecture - Dependency Injection (2 weeks)

### DI Approach REVISED

#### ❌ Original Plan: Custom DI Container
**Problems:**
- No type safety (`any` everywhere)
- No lifecycle management
- No circular dependency detection
- Maintenance burden
- Reinventing complex wheel poorly

#### ✅ Revised Plan: Simple Factory Pattern

**Week 1: Factory Setup**
```typescript
// services/ServiceFactory.ts
export class ServiceFactory {
  static createStatusService(
    repository: BaseRepository,
    config: Configuration
  ): StatusService {
    return new StatusService(repository, config);
  }

  static createResourceGroupManager(
    sourceControl: SourceControl,
    disposables: Disposable[]
  ): ResourceGroupManager {
    return new ResourceGroupManager(sourceControl, disposables);
  }
}
```

**Week 2: Repository Integration**
```typescript
constructor(repository: BaseRepository, secrets: SecretStorage) {
  this.statusService = ServiceFactory.createStatusService(repository, configuration);
  this.groupManager = ServiceFactory.createResourceGroupManager(
    this.sourceControl,
    this.disposables
  );
}
```

### Benefits
- Type-safe (no `any`)
- Simple (no external dependency)
- Easy to test (can mock factory)
- Clear ownership
- Battle-tested pattern

### Success Criteria
- All services created via factory
- Zero manual `new Service()` in business logic
- Services mockable in tests
- Extension startup <100ms
- No circular dependencies

---

## Phase 4: Tests (4 weeks) - NOW ACHIEVABLE

### Why Fourth
- With clean types, extracted services, and DI: can write effective tests
- 60% coverage MEANINGFUL (good architecture) vs 30% meaningless (god classes)

### Coverage Target REVISED
- ~~30% line / 20% branch~~ → **60% line / 45% branch**

**Rationale:**
- Repository (1,179 LOC) + SvnRepository (970 LOC) + Svn (369 LOC) = 2,518 LOC
- These 3 files = 40% of codebase, are refactoring targets
- 60%+ needed for confident Phase 5+ changes

### Test Priority REVISED

#### ❌ Original Order
Mock framework → Auth → Repo → Commands → Parsers → Security

#### ✅ Corrected Order
Security → Parsers → Exec → Auth → Repo → Commands

**Rationale:** Bottom-up testing. Foundation first.

### Weekly Breakdown

#### Week 1: Security + Parsers (Foundation)

**Security Test Suite** (validates Phase 0):
```typescript
// Test all 5 validators with boundary tests
describe('Command Injection Prevention', () => {
  it('rejects branch names with shell metacharacters', async () => {
    const malicious = ['branch;rm -rf', 'branch$(whoami)', 'branch`id`'];
    for (const name of malicious) {
      await expect(repository.newBranch(name, 'msg')).rejects.toThrow();
    }
  });
});

// Test XXE protection
describe('XML Parser Security', () => {
  it('rejects billion laughs attack', async () => {
    const bomb = '<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE lolz [...';
    await expect(parseStatusXml(bomb)).rejects.toThrow();
  });
});

// Test error sanitization
describe('Credential Sanitization', () => {
  it('never logs passwords', async () => {
    const spy = jest.spyOn(console, 'log');
    try { await repo.exec([...], { password: 'SECRET' }); } catch {}
    expect(spy.mock.calls.flat().join(' ')).not.toContain('SECRET');
  });
});
```

**Parser Tests** (all commands depend on these):
- Real SVN XML fixtures (captured from svn 1.8, 1.9, 1.10+)
- All status codes: normal, added, deleted, modified, conflicted, unversioned, missing, obstructed, replaced
- Edge cases: empty XML, malformed, partial
- Target: 80%+ parser coverage

#### Week 2: Execution Layer

**Svn.exec() Tests** (single point of failure):
- Encoding detection (Windows-1252, UTF-8, GB18030)
- Error code mapping
- Auth prompt handling
- Process spawn errors
- Mock framework for unit tests (NOT integration tests)

**Mock Strategy:**
```typescript
// Good: Mock YOUR abstractions
class MockSvn implements ISvn {
  exec = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ stdout: '<status>...</status>', stderr: '' });
}

// Bad: Don't mock SVN CLI - use real svnadmin create for integration tests
```

#### Week 3: Business Logic

**Auth Flow Tests** (5 scenarios):
- Initial auth prompt
- Credential storage/retrieval via SecretStorage
- Multi-account per repo
- Retry on failure (quadratic backoff)
- Credential invalidation

**Repository Operation Tests:**
- Status tracking
- Commit operations (including message files)
- Update/merge flows
- Conflict handling
- Changelist management

#### Week 4: Integration + Missing Categories

**Integration Tests:**
- Multi-service scenarios
- E2E workflows (checkout → commit → update → switch)

**Missing Test Categories** (identified by experts):
- State machine tests (implicit states need explicit tests)
- Concurrency tests (operations queued via `run()` decorator)
- Error recovery tests (SVN crash mid-operation, corrupt .svn dir)
- Performance tests (1000+ files, status latency)
- TOCTOU tests (file replacement during commit)

### Test Infrastructure

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Real SVN for integration tests (keep existing pattern from testUtil.ts)
- Mocks ONLY for unit tests (svn.exec() responses)
- Fixture library: real SVN XML from multiple versions

**Organization:**
```
src/test/
  unit/              # Mocked dependencies
    parsers/
    validation/
    svn.exec.test.ts
  integration/       # Real SVN
    auth.test.ts
    repository.test.ts
    commands.test.ts
  fixtures/          # Real SVN XML outputs
    svn-1.8-status.xml
    svn-1.9-log.xml
```

### Success Criteria
- 60% line / 45% branch coverage
- 80%+ coverage on Repository, SvnRepository, Svn classes
- All Phase 0 security hardening verified
- All parsers tested with real fixtures
- State machine transitions tested
- CI running tests <5 minutes
- Zero flaky tests

---

## Phase 4.5: Security Completion (3 days) 🔒 CRITICAL

### Why Needed
Phase 0 created validators but they're **NOT USED**. Critical security gaps remain.

### Tasks

#### Day 1: Apply Missing Validations
**validateRevision()** - Apply to 3 locations:
- `search_log_by_revision.ts:20` - currently uses manual regex
- `svnRepository.ts:177` - show() method
- `svnRepository.ts:311, 410` - additional show() calls

**validateFilePath()** - Apply to 12+ locations:
- All file add/remove/revert/commit operations
- `renameExplorer.ts:46` - path traversal risk
- `svnRepository.ts:430, 696, 776` - multiple file operations

**URL validation** - NEW validator needed:
- `checkout.ts:18` - SSRF prevention
- Add protocol allowlist (http, https, svn, svn+ssh)
- Reject `file://` URLs

#### Day 2: Credential Exposure Fix
**Problem:** Passwords visible in process list
```bash
ps aux | grep svn
# Shows: svn --password SECRET123 update
```

**Solution:** Use SVN config files not CLI args
```typescript
// Before: args.push("--password", options.password)
// After: Write to ~/.subversion/auth or use --config-option
```

#### Day 3: TOCTOU Protection
**Temp file creation** (svnRepository.ts:449-453):
- Use secure tmp.fileSync with proper mode
- Atomic write operations
- Symlink attack prevention

### Success Criteria
- All 5 validators APPLIED throughout codebase
- Zero unvalidated user inputs
- Credentials never in process args
- TOCTOU tests pass
- Security test suite updated

---

## Phase 5: State Management (2 weeks)

### Current State: Implicit

Repository has implicit states:
- Idle (no operation)
- Running operation (via `run()` decorator)
- Auth prompt
- Conflict state
- Remote changes pending

**Problems:**
- State transitions not explicit
- Race conditions possible
- No validation before operations

### Tasks

#### Week 1: State Machine
**States:**
- `uninitialized`
- `initializing`
- `ready`
- `updating_status`
- `committing`
- `updating`
- `auth_prompting`
- `error`
- `disposed`

**Implementation:** XState (lightweight, TypeScript-native)

```typescript
const repositoryMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'repository',
  initial: 'uninitialized',
  states: {
    uninitialized: { on: { INITIALIZE: 'initializing' } },
    initializing: { on: { SUCCESS: 'ready', ERROR: 'error' } },
    ready: {
      on: {
        UPDATE_STATUS: 'updating_status',
        COMMIT: 'committing',
        UPDATE: 'updating'
      }
    },
    // ...
  }
});
```

#### Week 2: Event Bus
- Ordered event processing
- Subscription management
- Event replay for debugging

### Success Criteria
- All state transitions explicit
- State machine prevents invalid operations
- Events logged for debugging
- UI updates driven by state
- Tests verify all transitions
- Zero race conditions

---

## Phase 6: Commands Refactoring (1-2 weeks)

### Current: Command.ts (492 lines)

**Problems:**
- Lots of boilerplate
- Repository coupling
- Duplicate patterns (20+ commands similar)

### Tasks

#### Week 1: Command Base Simplification
- Extract repository resolution logic
- Command middleware pattern
- Validation pipeline (use state machine)
- Error handling pipeline

**Target:** 492 → <250 lines

#### Week 2 (if needed): Command Utilities
- Shared validation helpers
- Progress reporting utilities
- Resource selection helpers

### Success Criteria
- Command base <250 lines
- Code duplication reduced 50%
- All commands use DI
- All commands testable
- Commands check state before execution

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Documentation (2 weeks)

### Tasks

#### Week 1: Security Hardening
- CodeQL workflow (SAST)
- Renovate (automated dependency updates)
- Security.md documentation

#### Week 2: Documentation
- Update ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md
- API documentation
- Performance benchmarks
- WCAG compliance check

### Success Criteria
- Zero CRITICAL/HIGH vulns
- Automated dependency updates
- All docs current
- No performance regressions
- Accessibility guidelines met

## Critical Success Factors

1. **No phase skipping** - Dependencies must be respected
2. **Phase gate enforcement** - Don't proceed if criteria not met
3. **Feature freeze** - No new features during Phases 1-3
4. **Continuous testing** - Manual E2E after each phase
5. **Documentation updates** - Keep ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md current
6. **Incremental commits** - Small, focused commits enable rollback

---

## Open Questions

1. **Team size:** Solo or team? (affects parallelization)
2. **Feature freeze acceptable:** During Phases 1-3?
3. **DI framework:** Factory pattern or library (TSyringe)?
4. **State library:** XState or custom FSM?
5. **Coverage target final:** 60% sufficient or aim higher?
6. **Versioning:** Bump to v3.0.0 after completion?

---

## Why Original Plan Failed

**Root Cause:** Dependency inversions

```
Tests written for bad architecture
  ↓
Tests couple to god classes
  ↓
Architecture refactored
  ↓
Tests need deletion/rewrite
  ↓
Technical debt compounds
```

**Corrected Approach:**

```
Clean types first
  ↓
Extract services (clear boundaries)
  ↓
Write meaningful tests
  ↓
Tests validate refactoring
  ↓
Architecture stable
```

---

## Lessons Learned (For Future Projects)

1. **Always type first** - Can't test weak types effectively
2. **Always extract before testing** - Can't test god classes meaningfully
3. **Bottom-up testing** - Foundation first (parsers → exec → business → UI)
4. **Realistic targets** - 650-750 lines vs 450-550, 3-4 services vs 7
5. **Incremental extraction** - One service per cycle, not big bang
6. **Simple patterns** - Factory over custom DI container
7. **Expert review critical** - 6 specialists caught fundamental flaws
