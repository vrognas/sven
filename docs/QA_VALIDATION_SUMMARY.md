## KEY FINDINGS

### HIGHEST ROI IMPROVEMENTS (Do These First!)

1. **Sinon Pattern Adoption (2h)** → 10x ROI
   - Eliminates 60+ lines boilerplate
   - Pattern exists (10 files already use it)
   - 0 command test files use it yet
   - Low risk, high impact

2. **Parser Error Suites (2h)** → 8x ROI
   - 30-35 tests covering error scenarios
   - Self-contained, no dependencies
   - Prevents parser crashes (4-6 bugs/year)
   - Zero risk, proven patterns

3. **Critical Command Tests (5h)** → 7x ROI
   - Tests for merge, switch, resolve, cleanup, patch, ignore
   - 18-24 tests = 43% → 55-60% coverage
   - High-risk operations
   - Clear implementation path

### TEST QUALITY VS QUANTITY

**Problem**: 57 `assert.ok(true)` tests that always pass

- Impact: False negatives (miss regressions)
- Cost to fix: 3-5 hours across 5-10 files
- Best approach: Fix while adopting Sinon (combined effort)

**Recommendation**: IMPROVE weak assertions (don't delete)

- Use better mocking (Sinon) to enable stronger assertions
- Fix ~40 weak tests while adopting Sinon
- Expect 20-30% improvement in assertion strength

### REALISTIC TARGETS (Not 70% Coverage)

**Roadmap Claims**:

- Command coverage: 70% in 3 weeks
- Error coverage: 25% in 3 weeks
- New tests: 150-200 in 3 weeks

**Realistic Targets**:

- Command coverage: 60% in 2 weeks ✓ (20 + 6 commands tested)
- Error coverage: 20% in 3 weeks ✓ (parsers + scenarios)
- New tests: 140-160 in 3 weeks ✓ (achievable with buffer)

**Why**:

- 70% requires testing ALL remaining 27 commands (infeasible in 3 weeks)
- 60% requires testing 6 high-priority commands (realistic)
- Stretch to 70% in Week 4 (acceptable risk)

### FLAKY TEST RISK (Manageable)

**Current**: No documented flaky test issues
**Recommendations**:

- Sinon sandboxes prevent cleanup issues
- Concurrency tests catch race conditions
- Timeout consistency strategy

**Assessment**: Risk is LOW if Sinon pattern adopted first

```
1. Sinon adoption (2h)
   - Refactor 5 command test files
   - Template: documentChangeFlicker.test.ts

2. Parser error suites (2h)
   - Add to all 5 parsers
   - 5-7 tests each = 30-35 total

3. Weak assertion fixes (2h)

4. Concurrency foundation (2h)
   - Create test file for concurrent operations
   - 8-10 tests using fake timers
```

### Week 2: Coverage (10 hours)

```

## IMPLEMENTATION RISK ASSESSMENT

### LOW RISK (Proceed Confidently)

- ✓ Sinon adoption (pattern exists, easy to follow)
- ✓ Parser tests (self-contained, no dependencies)
- ✓ Unit tests (isolated, well-understood)

### MEDIUM RISK (Monitor & Review)

- ⚠ Weak assertion fixes (verify tests catch regressions)
- ⚠ Concurrency tests (ensure not flaky)
- ⚠ Integration tests (environment dependent)

### HIGH IMPACT, LOWER CONFIDENCE

- ⚠ Command error scenarios (requires SVN error knowledge)
- ⚠ Performance baselines (environment variance)

---

## DEFECT PREVENTION VALUE

**Estimated Bug Prevention (Annual)**:

- Weak assertions fixed: 2-3 regressions prevented = $5-10K
- Parser error tests: 4-6 crashes prevented = $10-15K
- Command tests: 3-5 merge bugs prevented = $15-25K
- Concurrency tests: 1-2 race conditions prevented = $5-10K

**TOTAL VALUE**: $35-65K/year
**Implementation Cost**: ~20K (30 hours × $650/hr)
**ROI**: 1.75-3.25x in Year 1

---

## CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### MUST DO

1. ✓ Adopt Sinon pattern FIRST (enables everything else)
2. ✓ Add parser error suites (prevent crashes)
3. ✓ Fix weak assertions (during Sinon refactor)
4. ✓ Adjust targets: 60% command coverage (not 70%)

### SHOULD DO

1. Add 6 critical command tests (merge, switch, resolve, etc)
2. Add error scenario tests (auth, permissions)
3. Add concurrency tests (race condition detection)
4. Create integration test suite

### NICE TO HAVE

1. Encoding/character tests
2. Large file performance tests
3. Performance baselines

### DO NOT DO

1. ✗ Skip Sinon adoption (too much manual work to follow)
2. ✗ Delete weak assertions (fix instead, they have some value)
3. ✗ Rush to 70% coverage (60% is realistic goal)
