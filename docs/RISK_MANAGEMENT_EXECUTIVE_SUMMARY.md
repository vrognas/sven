---

## Dependency Chain & Sequencing

### Critical Blocking Dependencies

```
FOUNDATIONAL REQUIREMENT:
  Existing test suite must be 100% passing

Week 1 BLOCKER:
  Sinon pattern adoption
    ↓ unblocks ↓
Week 2 Refactoring (exec/execBuffer)
  ↓ unblocks ↓
Week 2 Refactoring (show/showBuffer)
  ↓ unblocks ↓
Week 3+ Test additions
```

### Parallelization Opportunities

**Can Execute in Parallel:**

- All P0 security fixes (Week 1)
- All performance optimizations (Week 1)
- All type safety improvements (Week 2+)
- All error handling improvements (Week 2+)
- All documentation (Week 3+)
- All test additions (after Sinon adopted)

**Must Execute Sequentially:**

- Sinon pattern → Refactoring → Test additions
- exec extraction → show extraction

**Efficiency Gain:** 60% of items can be parallelized → potential 30-40% time savings

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### 1. Testing Excellence [PRIMARY MITIGATION]

- Strengthen assertions before refactoring
- Adopt Sinon pattern for clean test isolation
- Comprehensive regression test suite
- 100% pass rate required before deployment

### 2. Incremental Deployment [SECONDARY MITIGATION]

- Small, focused changes per commit
- Atomic commits (easily reverted)
- 24-48 hour monitoring per phase
- Clear rollback procedures for each item

### 3. Code Review [TERTIARY MITIGATION]

- All changes require peer review
- Security review for injection fix
- Performance review for optimizations
- Type safety review for refactoring

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting [QUATERNARY MITIGATION]

- Post-deployment test suite runs
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metric tracking
- 24-48 hour observation period
