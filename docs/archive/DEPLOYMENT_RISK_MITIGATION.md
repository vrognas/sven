# Deployment Risk Mitigation & Rollback Procedures

**Purpose:** Detailed procedures to minimize risk and enable rapid rollback if needed

---

## Pre-Deployment Risk Assessment Checklist

### Universal Pre-Flight (All Phases)

```bash
# 1. Baseline Testing
npm test  # Must be 100% passing
npm run build  # Zero TypeScript errors
npm run lint  # No ESLint violations

# 2. Dependency Validation
npm audit  # Check for new vulnerabilities
npm ci  # Clean install with exact lockfile

# 3. Build Artifact Validation
npm run build  # Verify dist/ is valid
ls -lah dist/extension.js  # Confirm size < 200KB (size-limit)

# 4. Git State
git status  # Clean working directory
git log -1  # Verify target commit for reference
```

### Phase-Specific Pre-Deployment

**Before Week 1 Deployment:**

```bash
# Ensure SVN is available for testing
which svn  # Should find SVN executable
svn --version  # Confirm working SVN

# Test specific P0 items
npm test -- --grep "svn.*(discover|find|path)"  # SVN finder tests
```

**Before Week 2 Refactoring:**

```bash
# Ensure test infrastructure is solid
npm test  # All 65+ tests passing
npm run build:ts  # TypeScript compiles cleanly

# Baseline performance metrics
time npm test  # Execution time baseline
```

---

## Phase 1: P0 Critical (Week 1)

### Items to Deploy

1. Command injection fix (svnFinder.ts)
2. Password exposure documentation
3. semantic-release downgrade
4. Regex/dead code/magic number constants

### Pre-Deployment

**✓ Validation Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Verify no test regressions
npm test  # All tests must pass

# 2. Verify SVN discovery still works
npm test -- --grep "svn.*discover"
npm test -- --grep "svn.*find"

# 3. Validate command execution not affected
npm test -- --grep "exec"
npm test -- --grep "spawn"

# 4. Check build succeeds
npm run build:ts
npm run lint
npm run build

# 5. Validate bundle size
npm run size  # Should be < 200KB

# 6. Audit dependencies
npm audit  # Should be clean after semantic-release downgrade
```

### Deployment Procedure

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b fix/p0-critical-week1

# 2. Apply P0 fixes (atomic commits)
# a) Command injection fix
# b) Password exposure documentation
# c) semantic-release downgrade
# d) Extract constants

# 3. Test each commit
npm test  # After each significant change

# 4. Verify no regressions
npm test  # Full suite
npm run lint  # Style check
npm run build  # Production build

# 5. Create pull request
git push -u origin fix/p0-critical-week1
# Submit PR with test results attached

# 6. Code review + merge
# Require at least 1 approval before merge

# 7. Tag release (if using semantic versioning)
# Automatic via semantic-release after merge
```

### Post-Deployment Monitoring (24-48 hours)

**✓ Success Criteria:**

- All 65+ tests continue passing
- No error rate increase in logs
- SVN commands execute successfully
- No user-reported issues

**Monitoring Commands:**

```bash
# Check for runtime errors
npm test  # Re-run full suite in deployed environment

# Validate SVN integration
# Manual test: open repo, refresh status, commit a change

# Monitor logs
# Check for any assertion failures or exceptions
```

### Rollback Procedure (if needed)

**Rollback Priority:** LOW - changes are minimal and atomic

```bash
# Option 1: Revert single commit (safest)
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin

# Option 2: Revert entire branch
git reset --hard <previous-stable-commit>
git push -f origin  # Force push (use with caution)

# Option 3: Full redeploy from previous version
# Switch to previous release tag

# Verification after rollback
npm test  # Confirm tests still pass
npm run build  # Verify build succeeds
```

---

## Phase 2: Test Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

### Item to Deploy

1. Adopt Sinon stub pattern (#20)

### Why This Phase is Critical

**Sinon pattern adoption is a PREREQUISITE for:**

- Complex refactoring (exec/show extraction)
- New test additions
- Preventing test pollution

### Pre-Deployment

```bash
# 1. Understand Sinon lifecycle
# Review: https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/sandbox/

# 2. Test all command test files
npm test -- --grep "command"

# 3. Validate Sinon installation
npm list sinon  # Should be installed

# 4. Create Sinon test harness
# Build test infrastructure locally first
```

### Deployment Procedure

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b refactor/adopt-sinon-pattern

# 2. Update test infrastructure incrementally
# Start with one test file as template
# Apply pattern to remaining files (batch)

# 3. Test after each batch
npm test

# 4. Validate cleanup behavior
# Verify stubs are properly restored
# Check for test pollution (tests affecting each other)

# 5. Final validation
npm test  # All tests must pass
npm test -- --reporter json > test-results.json  # Record baseline
```

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

**✓ Success Criteria:**

- All 65+ tests passing
- No increase in test execution time
- No test pollution (tests independent)
- Test teardown happening correctly

**Verification Steps:**

```bash
# Run tests multiple times - should always pass
npm test
npm test  # Run again
npm test  # Run again (catches intermittent failures)

# Check test isolation
npm test -- --grep "command"  # Run subset
npm test -- --grep "svn"  # Run different subset
```

### Rollback Procedure

**Rollback Priority:** MEDIUM - affects test infrastructure

```bash
# Revert to pre-Sinon pattern
git revert <sinon-adoption-commit>

# Verify tests still work with old pattern
npm test

# Push rollback
git push origin
```

## Phase 3: Core Refactoring (Week 2)

### Items to Deploy (SEQUENTIAL)

1. Strengthen weak assertions (#22)
2. Extract exec/execBuffer (#5)
3. Extract show/showBuffer (#6)

### Critical Prerequisites

**MUST be complete before refactoring:**

```bash
# ✓ Sinon pattern adopted
npm test -- --grep "command"  # Verify Sinon usage

# ✓ Weak assertions strengthened
npm test  # All tests pass with strong assertions

# ✓ All tests passing at baseline
npm test  # 100% pass rate required
```

### Pre-Deployment: exec/execBuffer Extraction

```bash
# 1. Document current behavior
npm test -- --grep "exec" > baseline-exec-tests.txt

# 2. Capture performance baseline
time npm test  # Note execution time

# 3. Verify SVN command execution
npm test -- --grep "commit|update|status"  # All operations work

# 4. Check memory baseline
# Monitor process during test run

# 5. Validate error handling
npm test -- --grep "error|fail"
```

### Deployment Procedure: exec/execBuffer

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch for refactoring
git checkout -b refactor/extract-exec-logic

# 2. Create helper method _executeSpawnedProcess
# Extract shared logic carefully
# Maintain exact same behavior

# 3. Update exec() to use helper
# Test after each update
npm test

# 4. Update execBuffer() to use helper
# Test after update
npm test

# 5. Run comprehensive test suite
npm test  # All 65+ tests passing

# 6. Regression testing
npm test -- --grep "exec"  # exec-specific tests
npm test -- --grep "spawn"  # spawn-specific tests
npm test -- --grep "command"  # All command tests

# 7. Performance validation
time npm test  # Compare to baseline

# 8. Code review before merge
git push -u origin refactor/extract-exec-logic
```

### Post-Deployment Monitoring: exec/execBuffer

**Critical Monitoring (48 hours):**

```bash
# Day 1:
# - Monitor all SVN command executions
# - Check error rates haven't increased
# - Verify command latency is stable

# Day 2:
# - Run full regression tests
# - Spot-check manual SVN operations
# - Review any error logs

# Success Criteria:
# - Zero regressions in test suite
# - Command latency ±5% of baseline
# - Error rates unchanged
# - No new warnings/exceptions
```

### Rollback Procedure: exec/execBuffer

**Rollback Priority:** MEDIUM - HIGH (critical code)

```bash
# Revert refactoring commit(s)
git revert <refactoring-commit-hash>

# Verify tests pass with reverted code
npm test

# Push rollback
git push origin

# Notify team if reverted
# Plan remediation strategy
```

### Pre-Deployment: show/showBuffer Extraction

**Prerequisites:**

```bash
# ✓ exec/execBuffer stable for 24+ hours
# ✓ All tests passing
npm test

# ✓ No regressions reported
# ✓ Performance metrics stable

# ✓ show/showBuffer tests strong
npm test -- --grep "show"
```

### Deployment Procedure: show/showBuffer

```bash
# Similar to exec extraction, but lower risk
# 1. Create helper _prepareShowArgs
# 2. Update show() to use helper
# 3. Update showBuffer() to use helper
# 4. Run full test suite
# 5. Verify no regressions

# Commands:
git checkout -b refactor/extract-show-logic
npm test  # After each change
npm test -- --grep "show"  # Verify show operations
git push -u origin refactor/extract-show-logic
```

### Rollback Procedure: show/showBuffer

**Rollback Priority:** LOW - less critical than exec

```bash
# Revert show extraction
git revert <show-extraction-commit>

# Verify tests pass
npm test

# Push rollback
git push origin
```

## Phase 4: Type Safety & Error Handling (Week 2)

### Items to Deploy

1. Type annotations (#15-19)
2. Error handling improvements (#31-35)

### Pre-Deployment

```bash
# 1. Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run build:ts  # Zero errors

# 2. Run tests
npm test  # All passing

# 3. Lint check
npm run lint  # No violations

# 4. Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit  # Verify types are correct
```

### Deployment Procedure

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b refactor/type-safety-and-error-handling

# 2. Apply type annotations gradually
# Commit each file's type improvements separately

# 3. Apply error handling improvements
# Replace console.error, fix promises, add context

# 4. Test continuously
npm test  # After each group of changes

# 5. Final validation
npm run build:ts
npm run lint
npm test

# 6. Submit for review
git push -u origin refactor/type-safety-and-error-handling
```

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

**Low Risk** - compile-time only changes

```bash
# Immediate verification
npm test  # All tests pass
npm run build:ts  # No TypeScript errors

# Success Criteria:
# - All tests passing
# - No new runtime errors
# - Type checking is stricter
```

### Rollback Procedure

**Rollback Priority:** VERY LOW

```bash
# Simple revert
git revert <type-safety-commit>

# Verify
npm test

# Push
git push origin
```

2. Parser error tests (#21)
3. Strengthen assertions (#22)
4. Concurrency tests (#23)
5. Integration tests (#24)
6. Test missing commands (#25)

### Pre-Deployment

```bash
# 1. Verify Sinon pattern working
npm test  # All existing tests pass

# 2. Prepare test additions
# Write tests locally first
# Run against current code

# 3. Ensure code to test is stable
# exec/execBuffer and show/showBuffer must be stable
```

### Deployment Procedure

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b test/add-comprehensive-coverage

# 2. Add test files incrementally
# Commit each group of tests separately

# 3. Verify tests pass
npm test  # After each addition

# 4. Check coverage
# Measure improvement in coverage percentage

# 5. Final validation
npm test  # All tests passing
npm test -- --reporter json | grep '"pass"'  # Count passing tests

# 6. Submit for review
git push -u origin test/add-comprehensive-coverage
```

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

**Very Low Risk** - additions only, no code changes

```bash
# Verify:
npm test  # All tests passing
# Coverage increased from 43% to 70%+
# No test pollution
# Tests execute in reasonable time
```

### Rollback Procedure

**Rollback Priority:** VERY LOW

```bash
# Remove test files (if needed)
# Or simply don't merge the PR
git revert <test-addition-commits>
```

# 4. Optional: build documentation locally
# Verify it renders correctly
```

### Deployment Procedure

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b docs/comprehensive-documentation

# 2. Add documentation files
# Commit incrementally

# 3. Final review
# Check file paths are correct
# Verify all links work

# 4. Submit for review
git push -u origin docs/comprehensive-documentation
```

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

**Zero Risk** - documentation only

```bash
# Verify:
# - Files are readable on GitHub
# - Links work
# - Code examples are accurate
```

### Rollback Procedure

**Rollback Priority:** N/A - zero risk

```bash
# Remove documentation files (if needed)
git revert <documentation-commits>
```

# Emergency Rollback Procedures

## Quick Rollback (All Phases)

### If Critical Issue Detected

**Action Items (in order):**

1. **Immediate Stop** (within 5 minutes)

   ```bash
   # Identify issue
   # Notify team

   # Check current state
   npm test  # Run tests
   npm run build  # Verify build
   ```

2. **Revert Recent Changes** (5-15 minutes)

   ```bash
   # Find problematic commit
   git log --oneline -10

   # Revert it
   git revert <commit-hash>

   # Test
   npm test

   # Deploy reverted code
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Root Cause Analysis** (post-revert)
   ```bash
   # Understand what went wrong
   # Fix in separate branch
   # Test thoroughly before re-deploy
   ```

## Phased Rollback Strategy

| Issue Severity          | Response Time | Rollback Type           | Risk |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ---- |
| Critical (app broken)   | 5 min         | Single commit revert    | None |
| High (major regression) | 15 min        | Revert to stable commit | Low  |
| Medium (feature broken) | 30 min        | Selective revert        | Low  |
| Low (minor issue)       | Next sprint   | Fix forward             | N/A  |
