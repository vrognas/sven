# Implementation Risk Matrix - Quick Reference

**Purpose:** At-a-glance risk assessment and execution sequencing for all 85 quick wins

---

## Color-Coded Risk Legend

- **GREEN** - Go immediately, low risk, no blockers
- **YELLOW** - Conditional go, medium risk, requires prerequisites
- **RED** - Blocker identified, must wait for prerequisites
- **BLUE** - Parallel execution possible with other items

# Execution Sequencing

## Critical Path (Must be Sequential)

```
Start: Existing tests must pass 100%
  ↓
WEEK 1: P0 + Infrastructure (6 hours, mostly parallel)
├── All P0 items (1.5h, parallel)
├── Syntactic improvements A (35m, parallel)
├── Performance optimizations B (1h, parallel)
└── Sinon pattern adoption (2h, BLOCKING next)
  ↓
WEEK 2: Tests + Refactoring (6+ hours, mostly sequential)
├── Strengthen assertions (2h, needed by refactoring)
├── Error handling improvements (1h, parallel)
├── exec/execBuffer extraction (1h, sequential)
│   └── All tests must pass
├── show/showBuffer extraction (45m, sequential)
│   └── All tests must pass
└── Type safety improvements (2h, can start parallel)
  ↓
WEEK 3-4: Tests + Documentation (25+ hours, fully parallel)
├── Test additions (14h, parallel group D)
├── Documentation (11-17h, parallel group F)
└── Additional coverage as needed
```

# Risk Sign-Off

| Phase       | Decision                 | Owner        | Date       |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| P0 Critical | **APPROVED**             | Risk Manager | 2025-11-20 |
| P1 High     | **APPROVED conditional** | Risk Manager | 2025-11-20 |
| P2 Medium   | **APPROVED**             | Risk Manager | 2025-11-20 |

**Notes:**

- P1 refactoring requires strong test suite (Phase 1 prerequisite)
- All improvements can be rolled back individually without impact
- Monitoring required for 24-48 hours post-major deployments
