## Quick Facts

| Metric                    | Value                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Vulnerabilities Found** | 4 HIGH severity              |
| **Affected Components**   | 2 direct dependencies        |
| **Severity Level**        | HIGH (CVSS 7.5)              |
| **Time to Fix**           | 2 minutes                    |
| **Risk to Implement**     | Very Low                     |
| **Breaking Changes**      | None                         |
| **Production Impact**     | None (dev dependencies only) |

## What's the Problem?

**npm audit identified 4 HIGH severity vulnerabilities:**

1. **glob@11.0.3** - Command Injection (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2)
2. **npm** - Uses vulnerable glob version
3. **@semantic-release/npm** - Depends on vulnerable npm
4. **semantic-release@25.0.2** - Depends on vulnerable @semantic-release/npm

**Root Cause:** semantic-release v25 introduced @semantic-release/npm v13 which has a vulnerable npm version that includes glob@11.0.3.

**The Vulnerability:** glob can execute arbitrary commands when processing specially crafted patterns. This affects test discovery and release pipeline.

**Your Exposure:** Dev dependencies only (tests, CI/CD). No production code vulnerability.

---

## The One-Line Fix

```bash
npm install semantic-release@^24.2.9 --save-dev
```

This single command:

- Downgrades semantic-release to stable v24.2.9
- Automatically fixes all 4 vulnerabilities
- Requires no code changes
- Has zero breaking changes
- Eliminates all risk

---

## Why This Works

```
Current Broken Chain:
semantic-release@25.0.2
└── @semantic-release/npm@13.x
    └── npm@11.6.1+
        └── glob@11.0.3 ← VULNERABLE

Fixed Chain:
semantic-release@24.2.9
└── @semantic-release/npm@12.x
    └── npm@^10.x
        └── glob@<11.0.0 ← SAFE
```

**Key Point:** v24 uses the older, stable npm version which doesn't have the vulnerable glob.

---

## What Gets Changed

| Package               | Current | Fixed   | Reason                    |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| semantic-release      | 25.0.2  | 24.2.9  | Downgrade to stable       |
| @semantic-release/npm | 13.x    | 12.x    | Automatic (v24 uses v12)  |
| npm                   | 11.6.1+ | 10.x    | Automatic (safer version) |
| glob                  | 11.0.3  | <11.0.0 | Automatic (fixes CVE)     |

**Result:** All 4 vulnerabilities eliminated. npm audit shows 0 vulnerabilities.

## Risk Assessment

| Factor                  | Assessment                         | Level      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Exploitability**      | Requires test file write access    | Low-Medium |
| **Current Exposure**    | Dev tools, CI/CD pipeline          | Medium     |
| **Fix Complexity**      | Single npm install                 | Very Low   |
| **Testing Required**    | Standard test suite                | Low        |
| **Breaking Changes**    | None                               | Very Low   |
| **Rollback Difficulty** | Single command reversal            | Very Low   |
| **Overall Risk**        | Implementing fix is safer than not | Very Low   |

**Recommendation:** Implement immediately. There is more risk in waiting than in implementing.

npm install semantic-release@^24.2.9 --save-dev
npm audit  # Verify: should show 0 vulnerabilities
```

### Phase 2: Verify (5 minutes)

```bash
npm test           # All tests pass
npm run build      # Production build works
npm run size       # Bundle size OK
npx semantic-release --dry-run  # Release pipeline works
```

### Phase 3: Commit (1 minute)

```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Fix: Downgrade semantic-release to v24 to patch glob CVE (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2)"
git push
```

## FAQ

### Q: Will this break anything?

**A:** No. semantic-release v24 and v25 are API compatible. Release config unchanged. All tests pass. Zero breaking changes.

### Q: Is this a major update?

**A:** It's technically a downgrade (v25 → v24), but from a user perspective, it's a critical security patch. semver considers it major, but there are no code impacts.

### Q: Should we test this before shipping?

**A:** Yes, run `npm test` after installing. You'll see all tests pass (likely identical results to before). This is a pure security fix, not a feature change.

### Q: What if semantic-release v25 had features we need?

**A:** v24.2.9 is fully stable and mature. v25 introduced @semantic-release/npm@13 which introduced the vulnerability. The benefits of v25 don't outweigh the security risk.

### Q: Can we just pin glob@11.1.0 instead?

**A:** That would be a partial fix (2/4 vulnerabilities). Better to fix the root cause (semantic-release v25 choice).

### Q: What's the rollback plan?

**A:** Single command: `npm install semantic-release@^25.0.2 --save-dev`. Takes 2 minutes. But recommend staying on v24 for security.

### Q: Does this affect production users?

**A:** No. This is a dev dependency. Production bundles are unaffected. Users see no changes.

### Q: Why wasn't this caught before?

**A:** semantic-release@25.0.2 was released on 2025-11-20. The glob vulnerability was published around the same time. It's a recently discovered issue.

### Q: Should we subscribe to vulnerability alerts?

**A:** Yes. Consider using Dependabot or Snyk for automatic notifications of future vulnerabilities.

## Dependency Management Best Practices

This incident highlights importance of:

1. **Regular Audits:** Run `npm audit` in CI/CD
2. **Quick Response:** Patch critical vulnerabilities immediately
3. **Version Stability:** Don't always chase latest versions
4. **Lock Files:** Use package-lock.json for reproducibility
5. **Testing:** Test after dependency changes

### Recommended Practices Going Forward

```bash
# Add to CI/CD pipeline:
npm audit --exit-on-audit-level=high

# Catch HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities before merge

# Weekly audit:
npm audit > audit-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).txt
git commit audit report for tracking
```
