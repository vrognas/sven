## Implementation Priority

### PHASE 1: SAFE WINS (Go First - 3-4 hours)

| #   | Refactoring     | File                      | Effort | Risk    | Action    |
| --- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------ | ------- | --------- |
| 7   | Regex constants | svn.ts                    | 5 min  | ✅ Safe | Immediate |
| 8   | Dead code       | command.ts                | 2 min  | ✅ Safe | Immediate |
| 9   | Magic numbers   | svn.ts                    | 10 min | ✅ Safe | Immediate |
| 15  | Type events     | util.ts                   | 30 min | ✅ Safe | Immediate |
| 16  | Type guards     | svnFileSystemProvider.ts  | 20 min | ✅ Safe | Immediate |
| 17  | Type icons      | resource.ts               | 5 min  | ✅ Safe | Immediate |
| 18  | Type dispose    | util.ts                   | 2 min  | ✅ Safe | Immediate |
| 19  | Catch types     | Codebase                  | 1 hr   | ✅ Safe | Immediate |
| 12  | Watcher regex   | repositoryFilesWatcher.ts | 5 min  | ✅ Safe | Immediate |
| 13  | String methods  | svn.ts                    | 5 min  | ✅ Safe | Immediate |

**First Commit Wave**: 1 hour

- Bundle 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 (all simple constants/patterns)
- Run full test suite
- Zero behavior changes

**Second Commit Wave**: 2-3 hours

- Type safety (15-19)
- TypeScript validates all changes
- No runtime behavior change

**Status**: 🟢 GREEN LIGHT - Execute immediately

---

### PHASE 2: RISKY REFACTORINGS (After Phase 1 - 4-6 hours)

| #   | Refactoring         | File                | Effort | Risk     | Prerequisite                   |
| --- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| 10  | Error regex compile | svn.ts              | 15 min | ⚠️ Risky | Write 3 characterization tests |
| 11  | Branch regex cache  | branch.ts           | 20 min | ⚠️ Risky | Write 3 characterization tests |
| 14  | XML sanitization    | xmlParserAdapter.ts | 15 min | ⚠️ Risky | Write 3 characterization tests |

**Per-Refactoring Pattern**:

1. Write characterization tests (3 tests, document current behavior)
2. Run baseline performance benchmark
3. Implement refactoring
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Run performance benchmark (verify no regression)
6. Commit with performance notes

**Status**: 🟡 YELLOW LIGHT - Proceed with TDD + benchmarking

---

### PHASE 3: DANGEROUS REFACTORINGS (Plan Carefully - 10-15 hours)

#### #5: exec/execBuffer Extraction (CRITICAL)

**Files**: src/svn.ts (308 lines, 160 duplicated)
**Risk**: 🔴 DANGEROUS - Impacts command execution, error handling
**Complexity**: HIGH - Behavior divergence (error semantics, cancellation token)

**Must Do Before Implementation**:

1. Write 8 characterization tests documenting exact current behavior
2. Identify all callers (30-50+ uses of exec, 5-10 uses of execBuffer)
3. Test execBuffer with cancellation token (currently undefined behavior)
4. Decide: Option A (separate helpers) vs Option B (unified with flags)
5. Benchmark baseline performance

**Implementation Steps**:

- Commit 1: Extract `_setupSpawnedProcess` (setup logic only)
- Commit 2: Update exec() to use helper (no behavior change)
- Commit 3: Update execBuffer() to use helper (no behavior change)
- Commit 4: Delete duplicate code
- Commit 5: Run full regression tests + performance validation

**Rollback**: Any single commit reversible independently

**Status**: 🔴 RED LIGHT - Needs comprehensive planning document

---

#### #6: show/showBuffer Extraction (SKIP OR MANUAL)

**Files**: src/svnRepository.ts (140 lines, 95 duplicated)
**Risk**: 🔴 DANGEROUS - Async `getInfo()` complicates extraction
**Benefit**: Small (20 lines saved) vs complexity added

**Assessment**: Extraction benefit marginal. Duplication acceptable trade-off.
**Alternative**: Do manually after exec/execBuffer refactored (if refactoring improves pattern)

**Status**: 🔴 RED LIGHT - Recommend SKIP, revisit later

---

#### #1: Command Injection Fix (SECURITY)

**File**: src/svnFinder.ts
**Risk**: 🔴 DANGEROUS - Security critical, must not regress
**Pattern**: cp.exec() → cp.execFile()

**Must Do**:

1. Write test validating execFile used, not exec
2. Verify SVN finding still works
3. Test with special characters in SVN path (if possible)

**Status**: 🟡 YELLOW LIGHT - Important but isolated fix

---

#### #2: Password Exposure (SECURITY)

**File**: src/svn.ts
**Risk**: 🔴 DANGEROUS - Can't easily revert, affects auth flow
**Options**:

1. Document warning (quick, partial fix)
2. Use config file auth (medium, good fix)
3. Stdin password input (complex, best fix)

**Recommendation**: Start with Option 1, plan Option 2 for Phase 2

**Status**: 🔴 RED LIGHT - Requires separate security refactoring plan

---

#### #3-4: Dependencies (SECURITY)

**Files**: package.json
**Risk**: 🔴 DANGEROUS - Could break release pipeline
**Fixes**:

- `npm install glob@^11.1.0 --save-dev`
- `npm install semantic-release@^24.2.9 --save-dev`

**Must Do**:

1. Run `npm audit` (verify vulnerabilities fixed)
2. Run `npm test` (full suite passes)
3. Test release pipeline: `npx semantic-release --dry-run`
4. Keep old versions recorded for rollback

**Status**: 🟡 YELLOW LIGHT - Important, but test well

## Quick Decision Table

```
"Should I refactor X?"

Is it a constant/dead code/type safety fix?
→ YES: Implement immediately (Phase 1)

Does it change performance-sensitive code?
→ YES: Write characterization tests first (Phase 2)

Does it span multiple methods/files?
→ YES: Plan carefully, use Option A (separate helpers)

Does it affect error handling behavior?
→ YES: Document exact current behavior first

Does it involve security (injection, passwords)?
→ YES: Security review + detailed testing

Is the benefit less than the refactoring effort?
→ YES: Consider skipping (duplication acceptable)

Still unsure?
→ Write 3 characterization tests to understand behavior
```

---

## Testing Requirements by Risk Level

### SAFE Refactorings

- Existing tests pass (behavior unchanged)
- No new tests needed
- Static analysis sufficient

### RISKY Refactorings

- 3 characterization tests (document current behavior)
- Baseline performance benchmark
- Post-implementation validation
- Verify no regression

### DANGEROUS Refactorings

- 3-8 characterization tests
- Identify all callers/dependencies
- Edge case analysis
- Baseline + post performance benchmark
- Full regression test suite
- Code review + approval
- Rollback procedure documented

## Rollback Procedures

| Scenario                                   | Time   | Steps                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Safe refactoring failed tests**          | 2 min  | `git revert <commit>`, `npm test`            |
| **Risky refactoring perf regressed**       | 5 min  | `git revert <commit>`, benchmark             |
| **Dangerous refactoring behavior changed** | 10 min | `git log --oneline`, revert specific commits |
| **Dependency broke release**               | 15 min | `npm install <pkg>@<old>`, test release      |

---

## Metrics to Track

### Code Quality

- Lines removed (duplication)
- Cyclomatic complexity reduction
- Type coverage improvement

### Performance

- Baseline vs. post-refactoring
- Per-call overhead changes
- Memory usage patterns

### Testing

- Test pass rate (should be 100%)
- Coverage change (should maintain >50%)
- New test count (characterization tests)

### Safety

- Behavior equivalence (characterization tests)
- Error handling validation
- Security vulnerability status

## Recommended Sequence

**Week 1: SAFE (3-4h)** ✅

1. Phase 1 Commit 1: Constants + dead code
2. Phase 1 Commit 2: Type safety (bulk)
3. Run full test suite
4. Update CHANGELOG

**Week 2: RISKY (4-6h)** ⚠️

1. Characterization tests for #10, #11, #14
2. Performance baselines
3. Phase 2 Commit 1-3 (error regex, branch cache, XML)
4. Verify no regressions
5. Update docs

**Week 3-4: DANGEROUS (10-15h)** 🔴

1. Plan exec/execBuffer extraction carefully
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Implement in small commits (4-5 per extraction)
4. Full regression validation
5. Performance benchmarking
6. Code review + merge

## Key Insights from Codebase Analysis

### From LESSONS_LEARNED.md

- Service extraction pattern: Multiple small extractions > one big refactor
- TDD approach: Write 3 tests before implementation
- Small commits: Enable easy review, revert, cherry-pick

### From ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md

- Codebase matured through careful, incremental improvements
- P0/P1 performance fixes completed (4-5x improvements)
- Security sanitization 100% complete
- Test coverage target: 50-55% ✅ REACHED

### Risk Patterns

- Duplication extraction risky (behavior parity must be verified)
- Performance optimizations need baseline + benchmarking
- Security fixes need thorough testing (no regressions)
- Type safety improvements safe (TypeScript validates)

---

## Red Flags (Stop and Review)

- ❌ Making refactoring without characterization tests
- ❌ Combining multiple logical changes in one commit
- ❌ Skipping performance benchmark for perf-sensitive code
- ❌ Changing behavior while refactoring
- ❌ Merging without full test suite passing
- ❌ Removing error handling "for cleanliness"
- ❌ Refactoring security code without security review

---

## Final Recommendation

**Implement in Phases**:

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: All SAFE refactorings → 100% confidence
2. **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: RISKY refactorings with TDD → 85% confidence
3. **Phase 3 (Week 3-4)**: DANGEROUS refactorings with planning → 70% confidence

**Expected Impact**:

- 100 lines of code removed (duplication)
- 5-15% performance improvement (regex + cache optimizations)
- 0 security vulnerabilities (all fixed)
- 100% test pass rate maintained
- Zero behavior changes verified

**Confidence Level**: 🟢 HIGH (with proper execution of safety procedures)
