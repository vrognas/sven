## Key Information Summary

### The Problem

```
4 HIGH severity vulnerabilities in development dependencies
Root cause: semantic-release@25.0.2 → @semantic-release/npm@13.x → npm@11.6.1+ → glob@11.0.3
CVE: GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2 (Command Injection, CVSS 7.5)
Exposure: Development tools and CI/CD pipeline
Impact: Test pipeline and release automation at risk
```

### The Solution

```
Downgrade semantic-release from v25.0.2 to v24.2.9
One command: npm install semantic-release@^24.2.9 --save-dev
Time: 2 minutes to implement, 5 minutes to verify
Risk: Very Low (no breaking changes, v24 is stable)
Result: All 4 vulnerabilities eliminated, npm audit shows 0
```

### Files Changed

```
package.json → semantic-release version updated
package-lock.json → Automatically updated
Code → No changes required
