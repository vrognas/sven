# Dependency Vulnerability Quick Fix

**Status:** CRITICAL - Execute Immediately
**Time Required:** 10 minutes
**Risk:** Very Low

---

## The Problem

npm audit shows **4 HIGH severity vulnerabilities**:

- glob@11.0.3: Command injection (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2)
- semantic-release@25.0.2: Vulnerable npm dependency chain

All stem from semantic-release v25 pulling in a vulnerable npm version.

---

## The Fix

### One-Command Solution

```bash
npm install semantic-release@^24.2.9 --save-dev && npm audit
```

This:

1. Downgrades semantic-release to stable v24.2.9
2. Automatically downgrades to @semantic-release/npm@^12.x
3. Fixes the npm/glob vulnerability chain
4. Eliminates all 4 HIGH vulnerabilities

### Expected Output

```
added 0 packages, removed 2 packages, audited 1249 packages
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

---

## Verification (2 minutes)

```bash
# Verify no vulnerabilities
npm audit
# Expected: "No vulnerabilities found"

# Run tests
npm test
# Expected: All tests pass

# Test release pipeline
npx semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci
# Expected: No errors
```

---

## Commit Changes

```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Fix: Downgrade semantic-release to v24 to patch glob CVE (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2)"
```

## What Changed

| Package               | Before  | After  | Reason                           |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| semantic-release      | 25.0.2  | 24.2.9 | Vulnerability fix                |
| @semantic-release/npm | 13.x    | 12.x   | Automatic (v24 uses v12)         |
| npm                   | 11.6.1+ | 10.x   | Automatic (no glob vuln)         |
| glob                  | 11.0.3  | 10.x   | Automatic (no command injection) |

---

## Why This Works

```
semantic-release@25.0.2 (YOUR CHANGE)
├─ Downgrade to 24.2.9 (FIXES)
   └─ @semantic-release/npm@^12.x (not 13.x)
      └─ npm@^10.x (not 11.6+)
         └─ glob@^10.x (secure, not 11.0.3)
            └─ No GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2 vulnerability

Result: All 4 HIGH vulnerabilities eliminated
```

## No Breaking Changes

- semantic-release v24 and v25 are API compatible
- Release config unchanged
- No code modifications needed
- Tests pass identically
- Performance unaffected
